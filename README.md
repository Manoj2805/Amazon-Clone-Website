Project Title: Amazon Clone Website
Project Description:
This project involved building a front-end clone of the Amazon e-commerce platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose was to replicate key features and design elements to demonstrate web development skills, focusing on user interface and layout. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the features implemented:

Navigation Bar: The navigation bar includes the Amazon logo, search functionality, account management, and cart access. The design mimics Amazon’s intuitive user interface, with icons and dropdowns for category selection and language preferences.

Carousel Slider: A dynamic image slider at the top showcases promotional banners, similar to Amazon’s marketing features. Navigation arrows allow users to browse through different offers.

Product Sections: The homepage is divided into multiple product sections, displaying different categories such as grooming products, laptops, and office chairs. Each product is presented with images, descriptions, and links to “shop more.”

Best Sellers and Deals: There is a section dedicated to "Best Sellers" in various categories like sports and outdoors, alongside products under a specific price range (e.g., $25 deals). Each product card displays discount information and pricing.

Responsive Design: The site layout is responsive, ensuring it functions smoothly on various devices, from desktops to smartphones.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: Structuring the webpage with semantic elements.
CSS3: Styling the page with a focus on responsiveness and layout.
JavaScript: Basic interactivity, such as slider controls and handling dynamic content.
Learning Outcomes:

Improved proficiency in front-end development tools and techniques.
Gained experience in creating responsive, user-friendly layouts.
Familiarized myself with structuring large-scale e-commerce interfaces.
